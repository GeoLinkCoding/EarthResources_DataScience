# EarthResources_DataScience
3 Machine Learning projects for graduate level course "Earth Resources Data Science" at Colorado School of Mines

Project 1 - Unsupervised:
Using unsupervised learning methods like clustering and dimensionality reduction, drill core data will be explored to unravel potential minerologic patterns and relationships.

Project 2 - Classification:
Fault detection with geospatial imagery and supervised classification.

Project 3 - Regression:
Discharge prediction from upstream sites using regression.
